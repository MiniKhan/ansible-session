Over the course of this Ansible project, I worked on multiple real-world automation tasks using a control node to manage both Ubuntu and CentOS-based systems. 
The goal was to reduce manual effort and make system administration tasks faster, repeatable, and more reliable. I started by customizing the Ansible 
configuration and setting up an organized inventory with host groups, children groups, and separate configurations for each machine.Once the environment was ready,
I used Ansible to automate common tasks like installing web servers and databases, creating users, changing hostnames, managing files and directories, and handling service configurations. I also practiced using variables, conditionals, and system facts to apply the right commands depending on the operating system. Everything was executed through a combination of ad-hoc commands and playbooks, making the automation flexible and easy to scale.

This project gave me practical experience in writing clean, reusable playbooks and taught me how to approach infrastructure automation with clarity and structure.
It was a great learning journey that helped me understand the power of Ansible in managing multi-node environments and laid a strong foundation for deeper work in
DevOps and cloud engineering.
